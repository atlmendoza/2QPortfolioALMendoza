## 🎨 Why Use HSL in CSS?

HSL stands for Hue, Saturation, and Lightness — it's a way to represent colors in CSS that’s often more intuitive than RGB or hex values.

Here’s what each part means:

🎨 HSL Breakdown
Hue: The type of color, represented as a degree on the color wheel (0–360°)

0° = Red

120° = Green

240° = Blue

Saturation: Intensity or purity of the color (0% = gray, 100% = full color)

Lightness: How light or dark the color is (0% = black, 100% = white)
